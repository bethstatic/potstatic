            <p>Green means nature and life, and so does Potstatic, a hand-painted pot’s small business that started in 2016 in a small city in Venezuela, called Maracaibo, as an idea of giving a touch of green to your spaces, to bring nature to your home.
            <br><br>
            Potstatic was created as an option to beautify those places that need a personal touch. All of our terracotta pots are hand-painted with top notch materials to ensure quality and durability, and they are also painted with our best vibe, to make sure that you have in your home something totally personalized and made with love.
            In your living room, next to your laptop on your desk, on your night stand, in your kitchen or even on that boring shelf on the corner of the house, there’s always a place that needs a little green on it! Our painted pots will make your home a happy place, they will fit your personal style and please your plants.
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, we all know that flowers die and chocolates melt, but plants are forever, so why not give a living gift? Potstatic was also created as an option to demonstrate your loved ones how important they are for you by giving them something completely customized, and give them the joy to become a proud plant parent.
